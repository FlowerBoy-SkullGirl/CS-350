```
    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    Where could you improve?
    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
```

In this course, we were assigned a series of projects that led up to designing the hardware configuration and software for a prototype thermostat. I believe the code I produced adhered exactly to specification and did not leave room for runtime error. In the future, I would like to create more standard documentation, where diagrams are concerned. I did not fully understand how to interconnect different separate components in the state machine, and this shows somewhat in my state machine diagrams. I don't see myself particularly fond of any of the software tools used in this course, but it was nice to use a resistor for the first time, and I believe that will be useful to me in the future, as I will be more confident going into future projects. Many of the skills in this course are the same skills I learned while buidling my split ergonomic keyboard using arduino microcontrollers, and I hope to use those skills on more projects that assist me in my daily life. I may even make my own trackball or portable computer at some point. The project was essentially made to "fill in the blanks" on the code that would execute on the thermostat. As such, making it maintainable and adaptable meant: not adding unnecessary and undocumented functions, where possible; adding code that was as simple as possible to add the desired functionality, so there is little chance of unforseen and undefined behaviour; and adding comments where the purpose of the added code may seem unclear at first glance.
